# ML Linear Regression Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using a linear regression model.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. Linear regression, a popular technique in machine learning, is employed for this purpose.

## Files

- **hpp.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code implementation of the linear regression model for house price prediction. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **README.md**: You're currently reading it! This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for navigating the repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `hpp.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to execute the code and train the linear regression model.
4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by following the guidelines provided in the notebook.
